# ICMP Timestamp Request Remote Date Disclosure Mitigation

## Vulnerability ID: `10114`
- **Severity**: Low
- **Affected System**: Domain Controller (DC1)
- **Description**: The vulnerability allows an attacker to retrieve the timestamp set on the targeted machine, which can assist in time-based attacks such as defeating time-based authentication protocols or performing DoS attacks.

## Mitigation Steps
1. **Disable ICMP Timestamp Responses**:
   - On Windows:
     - Open Command Prompt as Administrator and run:
       ```bash
       netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Disable ICMP Timestamp" protocol=icmpv4:13,any dir=in action=block
       ```
     - This will block inbound ICMP Timestamp requests.

   - On Linux:
     - Open the terminal and add the following line to `/etc/sysctl.conf`:
       ```bash
       net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_all = 1
       ```
     - Then apply the changes:
       ```bash
       sudo sysctl -p
       ```

2. **Network Access Controls**:
   - Implement firewall rules to block ICMP timestamp requests at the network perimeter.
   - Restrict ICMP traffic to trusted hosts and networks only.

3. **System Configuration**:
   - Configure all servers and network devices to use a synchronized time source (such as NTP) to prevent the risk of attacks based on time discrepancies.

## Additional Recommendations
- Implement logging for all ICMP requests to monitor for potential scanning attempts.
- Regularly review the system for unusual ICMP traffic patterns.

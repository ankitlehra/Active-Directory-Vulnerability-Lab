# Elasticsearch Transport Protocol Unspecified Remote Code Execution Mitigation

## Vulnerability ID: `105752`
- **Severity**: Critical
- **Affected System**: Metasploitable3
- **Description**: This vulnerability allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system, caused by an error in the transport protocol. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the system.

## Mitigation Steps
1. **Upgrade Elasticsearch**:
   - Upgrade to a secure version: `1.6.1` or `1.7.0`.
   - If these versions are not compatible with your environment, consider upgrading to the latest stable release to address security flaws.

2. **Network Access Control**:
   - Restrict access to the Elasticsearch transport protocol to trusted internal networks only.
   - Set up firewall rules to limit access to the port `9200` used by Elasticsearch to internal IPs only.

3. **Enable Transport Layer Security (TLS)**:
   - Configure TLS to encrypt communications between Elasticsearch nodes and protect against unauthorized access.

4. **Monitor and Log Traffic**:
   - Enable logging and monitor network traffic to detect any unauthorized access or unusual activity.

## Additional Recommendations
- Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to provide an additional layer of security.
- Regularly update Elasticsearch and related software to the latest versions.
